```

Install all the dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

First thing you'd have to change both `config.json` file
```json
{
    "consumer_key": "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY", 
    "consumer_secret": "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET",
    "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "access_token_secret": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
}
```
and `client_secrets.json` file 
```json
{
    "web": {
      "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
      "redirect_uris": [],
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
    }
  }
```
Then , you're ready to go ðŸš€ðŸš€

Execute the program on the command line:
```bash
# If you're using Windows
python automation.py  

# If you're using Linux/MacOS
python3 automation.py  
```

Once the code has been executed, it will ask you to specify the twitter account user where you want to download the images from. And then you'll be asked for the number of images/post that you want to download.
